# TONVERK.WORLD

A searchable shortcuts reference for the Elektron Tonverk.

I built this because I kept forgetting key combinations mid-session. The manual is thorough but not exactly something you want to flip through while a sequence is running. This puts every shortcut in one place, organized by section, with search so you can find what you need fast.

Covers clipboard operations, sequencer controls, track/pattern management, performance features, sound design shortcuts, sampling, and system functions. Based on OS 1.2.1.

## Save it for offline use

The site works as a progressive web app. Visit [tonverk.world](https://tonverk.world) once, and you can add it to your home screen (or install it from your browser). After that it works without an internet connection — useful if your studio setup doesn't have great wifi, or if you're on the go.

- **iOS Safari**: tap Share, then "Add to Home Screen"
- **Android Chrome**: tap the menu, then "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"
- **Desktop Chrome/Edge**: click the install icon in the address bar
