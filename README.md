# TONVERK.WORLD

A searchable shortcuts reference for the Elektron Tonverk.

I built this because I kept forgetting key combinations mid-session. The manual is thorough but not exactly something you want to flip through while a sequence is running. This puts every shortcut in one place, organized by section, with search so you can find what you need fast.

Covers clipboard operations, sequencer controls, track/pattern management, performance features, sound design shortcuts, sampling, and system functions. Based on OS 1.2.1.
